            <b>Our planetary system is located in an outer spiral arm of the Milky Way galaxy.</b> Our solar system consists of our star, the Sun, and everything bound to it by gravity â€“ the planets Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus,
            and Neptune; dwarf planets such as Pluto; dozens of moons; and millions of asteroids, comets, and meteoroids. Beyond our own solar system, we have discovered thousands of planetary systems orbiting other stars in the Milky Way.</p>

                    <p class="card-text">Mercury is the first planet from the Sun and the smallest planet in the Solar System. It is a terrestrial planet with a heavily cratered surface due to the planet having no geological activity and an extremely tenuous atmosphere (called
                        an exosphere). Despite being the smallest planet in the Solar System with a mean diameter of 4,880 km (3,030 mi), 38% of that of Earth's, Mercury is dense enough to have roughly the same surface gravity as Mars. Mercury has a dynamic
                        magnetic field with a strength about 1% of that of Earth's and has no natural satellites.</p>

                        Venus is the second planet from the Sun. It is a rocky planet with a mass and size narrowly second in the Solar System to Earth, and with an atmosphere, which is the thickest of all four rocky planets of the Solar System and substantially thicker than
                        Earth's. Its orbit is the next closest to Earth's, orbiting the Sun inferior inside of Earth's orbit, appearing (like Mercury) in Earth's sky always close to the Sun as either a "morning star" or "evening star".

                        surface water, extending over 70.8% of the planet with its ocean, making it an ocean world. The polar regions currently retain most of all other water with large sheets of ice covering ocean and land, dwarfing Earth's groundwater,
                        lakes, rivers and atmospheric water.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">Mars is the fourth planet and the furthest terrestrial planet from the Sun. The reddish color of its surface is due to finely grained iron(III) oxide dust in the soil, giving it the nickname "the Red Planet".[20][21] There is a
                            sharp contrast between the two Martian hemispheres: the northern hemisphere is on average flatter and smoother than the southern hemisphere. The planet's two poles are covered by water and carbon dioxide ice caps. Surrounding
                            the Martian surface is a dynamic thin atmosphere (1% of Earth's surface pressure), made primarily of carbon dioxide. Mars has two irregularly shaped natural satellites, Phobos and Deimos.

                            the mass of the Sun. Jupiter is the third brightest natural object in the Earth's night sky after the Moon and Venus, and it has been observed since prehistoric times. It was named after Jupiter, the chief deity of ancient
                            Roman religion.</p>

                            density of Earth, but is over 95 times more massive.[27][28][29] Saturn's interior is thought to be composed of a rocky core, surrounded by a deep layer of metallic hydrogen, an intermediate layer of liquid hydrogen and liquid
                            helium, and finally, a gaseous outer layer. Saturn has a pale yellow hue due to ammonia crystals in its upper atmosphere.</p>

                            Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun and is a gaseous cyan ice giant. Most of Uranus is made out of water, ammonia, and methane in a supercritical phase of matter, which in astronomy is called 'ice' or volatiles. The planet's atmosphere has a complex
                            layered cloud structure and has the lowest minimum temperature of 49 K (âˆ’224 Â°C; âˆ’371 Â°F) out of all Solar System's planets. Uranus has a marked axial tilt of 97.8Â° with a retrograde rotation rate of 17 hours. This means that
                            in an 84 Earth years orbital period around the Sun, its poles get around 42 years of continuous sunlight, followed by 42 years of continuous darkness.

                            Neptune is the eighth planet from the Sun and the farthest known planet in the Solar System. It is the fourth-largest planet in the Solar System by diameter, the third-most-massive planet, and the densest giant planet. It is 17 times the mass of Earth,
                            and slightly more massive than its near-twin Uranus. Neptune is denser and physically smaller than Uranus because its greater mass causes more gravitational compression of its atmosphere. Being composed primarily of gases and
                            liquids, it has no well-defined solid surface. The planet orbits the Sun once every 164.8 years at an average distance of 30.1 astronomical units (4.5 billion kilometres; 2.8 billion miles). It is named after the Roman god
                            of the sea and has the astronomical symbol â™†, representing Neptune's trident.[d]
